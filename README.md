# Hi, I'm Mason! 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in London, UK, currently working on applied machine learning.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

At the time you're reading this, I work on personalisation (that's search and recommendations) at [ASOS](https://asos.com): one of Europe's biggest online fashion retailers. With [these fine people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOfBPPvBmk), no less.

Before that I worked at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), embedding with companies and governments around the world to help them bootstrap and scale data science projects using [Azure](https://azure.com) to their advantage.

As for my work on GitHub, I'm currently learning to repeatably build interesting web apps with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

I like to build real world, scalable products with measurable impact - particularly if this involves using both my data science and traditional software engineering skills. A [big company](https://microsoft.com) once employed me as an Applied Scientist. 🧙‍♂️

## 🤡 Play

🎸 I'm a mediocre but enthusiastic guitar player.

🇹🇼 I've been learning Mandarin Chinese for a number of years. My interest was sparked living in [Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY) during the summer of 2016, where I worked for a local start-up.

✍️ Every so often, some thinking or tinkering I'm doing spills over into a [blog](https://bloggingintensifi.es), which I wish I had more time to write!
