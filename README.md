# Hi! I'm Mason ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with experience in cloud software development - primarily applied AI.

Check out my work history [here](https://masoncusack.github.io).

TLDR: I help people apply AI, and try to build cool and useful apps people enjoy, for [Relevant Labs](https://relevantlabs.io).

Thanks for stopping by!
