# Hi, I'm Mason! 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with experience in cloud software development - primarily applied AI.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

Check out my work history [here](https://masoncusack.github.io).

I do my day job on GitHub and spend much of my own time working on independent SaaS apps here for [Relevant Software](https://relevantsoftware.io).

## 🤡 Play

🎸 I love live music and making music by playing guitar and producing beats.

🇹🇼 I've been learning Mandarin for a while. My interest was sparked living in [Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY), China for the summer of 2016. In 2023 I lived in Taipei, Taiwan.
