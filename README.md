# Hi, I'm Mason! 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in London, UK, with experience in cloud software development - primarily applied AI.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

Most recently, I worked on personalisation (that's search and recommendations) at [ASOS](https://asos.com): one of Europe's biggest online retailers, with [these fine people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOfBPPvBmk).

Before that I worked at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), embedding with companies and governments around the world to help them launch and scale data science projects using [Azure](https://azure.com) to their advantage.

As for my work on GitHub, I'm currently learning to repeatably build interesting web apps with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

I like to build useful products, and work in teams who take pride in their work and are committed to continuous improvement - particularly if this involves using a breadth of skillsets including software engineering and applied science (though [it's all software really](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/technology) 🤫).

## 🤡 Play

🎸 I love live music and making music by playing guitar and producing beats.

🇹🇼 I've been learning Mandarin Chinese for a number of years. My interest was sparked living in [Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY) in the summer of 2016, where I worked for a local start-up.

✍️ Every so often, some thinking or tinkering I'm doing results in a [blog](https://bloggingintensifi.es), which I wish I had more time to write!
