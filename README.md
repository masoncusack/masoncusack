# Hi, I'm Mason! 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with experience in cloud software development - primarily applied AI.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

I currently live in [Taipei, Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_fY1pj1VBw), where I'm learning Mandarin Chinese and developing a new SaaS product.

In my last job I worked on personalisation (that's search and recommendations) at [ASOS](https://asos.com): one of Europe's biggest online retailers, with [these fine people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOfBPPvBmk).

Before that I worked at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), embedding with companies and governments around the world to help them launch and scale data science projects using [Azure](https://azure.com) to their advantage.

As for my work on GitHub, I'm currently learning to repeatably build interesting web apps with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

I like to build useful products, and work in teams who take pride in their work and are committed to continuous improvement.

## 🤡 Play

🎸 I love live music and making music by playing guitar and producing beats.

🇹🇼 I've been learning Chinese for a while. My interest was sparked living in [Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY) in the summer of 2016, where I worked for a local start-up.
