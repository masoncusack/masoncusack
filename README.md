# Hi, I'm Mason! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in London, UK, currently working on applied Machine Learning.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

At the time you're reading this, I work on search personalisation at [ASOS](https://asos.com): one of Europe's biggest online fashion retailers. With [these fine people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOfBPPvBmk), no less.

Before that I worked at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), embedding with companies around the world to help them bootstrap and scale data science projects using [Azure](https://azure.com) to their advantage.

As for my work on GitHub, I'm currently hammering away at:

- 📊 A simple, customisable experiment tracking dashboard for the typical data science team.
- 🥞 A fast-deploying stack for scalable, cloud-based experimentation and deployment for machine learning projects. I should definitely name this with some kind of reference to pancakes.

These are primarily motivated by my own requirements, but are also inspired by my experience seeing what's missing from the DS/ML ecosystem in my day job.

To borrow some famous last words: they should be open sourced soon.

## 🤡 Play (things I wish I had more time for)

🎸 Music was my first love. I'm a mediocre but enthusiastic guitar player. Recently, I started taking lessons again and can't get enough of it.

🇹🇼 I've also been learning Mandarin Chinese for a number of years. I could use a lot more conversation practice (plans for which are afoot), but have really enjoyed diving into such a different language. I lived in [Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY) for the summer of 2016, working for a start-up, where this interest began.

✍️ Every so often, some thinking or tinkering I'm doing spills over into a [blog](https://bloggingintensifi.es). Though I take an unreasonable amount of time to write something, I'd very much like to do more of this, so am looking for ways of freeing up the time needed.
